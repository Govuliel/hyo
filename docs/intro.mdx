# Introduction

## What is Hisyëö?

A constructed language for people around the world to communicate with each
other. Hisyëö is designed using these principles:
- **Neutrality**, words are sourced from all world languages proportional to the
square root of their world population of L1 speakers. Many people who would come
to learn Hisyëö may have a small anchor of familiarity within the lexicon.
Additionally, the grammar is considered an analytic isolating language like its
forebears [Kokanu](https://www.kokanu.com/) and [Toki
Pona](https://tokipona.org). Analytic isolating languages like these remove the
mutation of words by making grammatical syntax separate particle words. The
grammar might be more complex than some minimalist languages but the design is
intented to help make Hisyëö less ambiguous overall which supports the
neutrality and expressivity principles.
- **Succinctness**, words are kept to a minimum where possible but information
density is strongly emphasized so that the language can still be used for
translations of scientific and artistic media. This principle is not the same as
the more strict principle of *minimalism* in that it is meant to allow for
including singular words from (1) concepts that appear in a multitude of
conversations and (2) concepts that would need complex nested clauses that can
otherwise derail a sentence from comprehension due to the added working memory
to develop an understanding of the sentence. Careful consideration is made that
the semantic spaces that each individual word covers do not overlap other words
although there will be times where you can build a similar concept by using
compound phrases and this is okay and provides users with additional ways to
clarify their intended meaning.
- **Expressivity**, the language is designed to be highly expressive in its word
and grammar choices. With just over 800 words, there's a lot more ways to
express feelings, emotions, objects, actions and anything else you can think of.
Additionally, the grammar has changed considerably from its origin to allow for
handling of tense, aspect, mood, causation, and volition. The language has been
tested against a multitude of translation media to confirm that no concept is
too challenging or too verbose to express.

Some of these principles and the language features that you will learn may seem
contrary to the practices of any self-respecting [International Auxiliary
Language](http://interlanguages.net). Hisyëö does not strictly follow the
tradional principles. The creators believe that too much effort within IAL
development is spent on regularization and cherrypicking existing lexical and
grammatical tactics of natural languages (while applying some first language
bias regardless of the best intentions). Instead, Hisyëö pushes closer to an
[artlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) or a
[loglang](https://loglangs.wiki/Portal) by focusing less on ease-of-learning and
instead striving for a more complete linguistic system.

## Is Hisyëö An International Auxiliary Language?

Hisyëö **does not** intend to be an international auxiliary language. Instead,
it strives to be a diverse community of people that seek to create a culture of
acceptance, respect, love, nonconformity and creativity. Through the language
and activities of the servers, chat rooms and local events, we hope to *reenact*
the future state of humanity. A [living history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_history) of
the future, if you will.

We do not condone the colonization or assimilation of peoples but we believe
that the current cultures of our world are designed to isolate us into nation
states to fund the machinations of capitalists and despots. Therefore, we
respectfully seek to timeskip our way into a future all-human society.

## Where did Hisyëö come from?

Hisyëö was borne out of a desire from a member of the Kokanu community to grow
Kokanu into something that could truly be versatile enough to be used for
translations of popular media, scientific papers and philosophical treateses.
Unfortunately for him, the Kokanu community intends the language to be as
minimalist as possible and so the density of information when translating is not
a consideration. Neither translation of media nor scientific communication are
goals of the language. Having spent considerable time becoming fluent in Kokanu
and being inspired by an—at the time—new kokanido
([koanu](https://www.parallax.net.nz/x/koanu/)), this Kokanu
community member decided to try to create his own kokanido, enhancing it with
some ideas taken from other constructed and natural languages.

## The Basics

Now that you understand why and where Hisyëö came from, let's learn enough to
write a few basic sentences.

### Sounds

*Contains US English example words.*

#### Vowels
- o as in sl**o**t or f**a**ther
- ö as in r**o**pe or Camb**o**dia
- e as in b**e**d or c**a**t
- ë as in m**a**y or f**a**ce
- ı as in c**i**ty or w**i**ll
- i as in happ**y** or c**ei**ling
- u as in r**u**n or en**ou**gh
- ü as in l**o**se, thr**ou**gh

#### Consonants
- h as in **h**am or **h**old
- k as in **c**up or sti**ck**
- g as in **g**old or sna**g**
- t as in **t**ip or pu**tt**
- z as in **ch**ore or na**t**ure
- s as in mi**s**t or i**c**e
- x as in a**sh** or ra**t**ion

- l as in **l**inger or ba**ll**ad
- y as in **y**earn or ma**y**o

### Rules

1. Words do not ever mutate, special particles are used to introduce phrases of
   the sentence.
2. Verbs, nouns, and modifiers (adjectives/adverbs) can be used as each other
   depending on what role they play in the sentence.
3. There is no word for "the".
4. The basic structure of a sentence is (in any order) one verb phrase and any
   amount of additional noun phrases.
5. If the verb prhase is placed as the first constituent of a sentence, then the
   particle that introduces the phrase can be omitted.

### Usage

Some basic words to get you started on sentence construction.

#### Choose a subject:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>noyo <em>I</em></p>
   <p>nimü <em>you</em></p>
   <p>nü   <em>we</em></p>
   <p>niün <em>they</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Choose a verb:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>köto   <em>to say</em></p>
   <p>monodo <em>to meet</em></p>
   <p>mokon  <em>to eat</em></p>
   <p>vısun  <em>to know</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Choose an object:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>ulyö   <em>that</em></p>
   <p>küöxı  <em>fruit</em></p>
   <p>pioli  <em>hello</em></p>
   <p>sütüö  <em>friend</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Choose a sentence ender:
<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>lötven <em>polite</em></p>
   <p>voxo   <em>surprise</em></p>
   <p>ko     <em>question</em></p>
   <p>löicök <em>confirmation</em></p>
   <p><em>or none</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

#### Now, make a sentence...

<HisyeoTabs>
   <p>noyo mokon küöxı <em>I eat fruit</em></p>
   <p>nimü vısun sütüö noyo ko <em>Do you know my friend?</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>
