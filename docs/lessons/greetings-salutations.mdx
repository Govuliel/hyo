# Greetings & Salutations

How to say hello, introduce yourself and describe where you're from.

## Verbs & Gerunds.

Meeting someone involves the verb <HisyeoWord is='monodo'/> and a usage of a
subordinate clause (an inner sentence). The subordinate clause acts similar to a
[gerund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund) would in English, meaning that it 
allows you to refer to the action of the verb as a noun.

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>lı küzoü ü do kelo vio öni tüek.&emsp;<em>Playing on computers is awesome.</em></p>
    <p>noyo süko do kelo vio öni tüek.&emsp;<em>I like playing on computers.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

I didn't start the first example with a subject and instead provided it after
the verb (<HisyeoWord is='lı'/>) by using the subject preposition
(<HisyeoWord is='ü'/>) because this allowed me to introduce the subordinate
clause at the end of the sentence which reduces the need for a comma or a pause
when speaking. In the second sentence, since the subordinate clause is being
provided as the object of the verb, it also is the last argument of the
sentence.

## Meet & Greet

Using this knowledge, we can build the first sentences for meeting people.
