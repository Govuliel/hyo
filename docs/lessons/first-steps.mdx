# First Steps

What is this language and how do you pronounce it?

## World Language

Hisyëö is a *world* language and *art* language that attempts to create a
batteries-included opinionated platform for cross-cultural expression.

It takes words from all of the world's families of languages so that there is a
little of everyone's language within it. Each language family gets a
proportional amount of words. The proportion size is determined by taking the
percentage of the total of the square roots of recent counts of the L1
population speakers of each language. By using a square root distribution, the
larger language families have a reduced proportion and the lesser families have
a slightly increased proportion. These amounts are considered a tolerance marker
and each family will fluctuate between position and negative offsets from the
tolerance amount.

This principle allows Hisyëö to have a representation of as many people as
possible. Since the larger language families get a large amount of words due to
the proportioning (even in a square root distribution), it ends up making their
language learning experience better than others. To combat this, smaller
language families always get prioritization when conflicts arise and new words
need to be located. This only makes a minor impact on the major language
families but greatly impacts the minor ones.

:::caution Not Your Native Language

While words are being taken from languages it is important to remember that this
language is not your native language, you will need to abandon any other rules
or word changes that you might normally make. The word can be used as a noun,
verb, or modifier so there's a good chance it will be used in a way that seems
wrong to your native language's grammar.

**This is okay.** Try to focus on the essence of that native language word,
imagine it being translated as the other parts of speech. Now think of the
Hisyëö word as covering all of these words. This is why we include all of the
different derivation translations in each definition, so that you can
familiarize yourself with all the ways it can be utilized.

:::

It's also an art language because it has taken the core of Kokanu and added many
aesthetic, syntactic, and semantic ideas that allow it to be used as an everyday
communication platform right now albeit with a starting "culture" in a similar
way to how art language creators establish history to explain their language's
idiosyncracies. The culture of Hisyëö is a representation of what the creators
believe to be
- the fundamentals of a modern democratic society
- the necessary critical tools to authentically discuss bad things
- lastly, a fun and whimsical inclination that tries to bring some uniqueness

That being said, there are no mythological stories to anchor you like you might
find in a natural society. Because of this, there's a risk that these ideas will
fade as the language gains a true living culture. The community must remain
vigilant that the things that make Hisyëö great never fade but they must also be
ever watchful for aspects of the culture that bring negativity or fascism.

## Common Expressions

One important first step to engaging with a new culture is to learn the common
phrases that are the lifeblood of any encounter. These words sometimes take on
additional roles as interjections and simple sentences. Learning these will make
it much easier to engage in polite and impolite conversation and get your feet
wet so that you can begin your immersion training.

The following are some of the current established expressions that Hisyëans use
in day-to-day conversation:

## Pronunciation

Learning how to pronounce the words requires learning how each of the 24
phonemes work and how they combine to form syllables. Each translation has a
wide array of acceptable alternatives that you can use if certain sounds are too
challenging. The distance between each sound can be subtle in certain words and
with certain speakers but the words were chosen in such a way that there
shouldn't be words that have a nearby pronunciation which would be too difficult
to differentiate.
