# First Steps

What is this language and how do you pronounce it?

## World Language

Hisyëö is a word language. It takes words from all of the world's families of
languages so that there is a little of everyone's language within it. Each
language family gets a proportional amount of words. The proportion size is
determined by taking the percentage of the total of the square roots of every
recent estimations of the L1 population (first language) speakers of each
language. By using a square root distribution, the larger language families have
a reduced proportion and the lesser families have a slightly increased
proportion. These amounts are considered a tolerance marker and each family
will fluctuate between position and negative offsets from the tolerance amount.

This principle allows Hisyëö to have a representation of as many people as
possible (and a little extra to the underdogs). Additionally, there are now
a few words that you are already familiar with from your first language that
should give you a small anchor point for learning the language.

:::caution Not Your Native Language

While words are being taken from languages it is important to remember that this
language is not your native language, you will need to abandon any other rules
or word changes that you might normally make. The word can be used as a noun,
verb, or modifier so there's a good chance it will be used in a way that seems
wrong to your native language's grammar.

**This is okay.** Try to focus on the essence of that native language word, imagine
it being translated as the other  parts of speech. Now think of the Hisyëö word
as covering all of these words. This is why we include all of the different
derivation translations in each definition, so that you can familiarize yourself
with all the ways it can be utilized. In fact, the provided descriptions are
just at the basic level because when you start making compound phrases including 
these words, the meaning now must be interpreted in terms of the head noun's 
essence or in terms of the head verb's activity.

## Common Expressions

All languages have phrases that are said frequently and take on additional roles
as interjections or greetings. Learning these will make it much easier to engage
in polite conversation and get your feet wet so as to begin the immersion
training.

:::info Examples

The following are some of the current established expressions that Hisyëans use
in day-to-day conversation:
- %%voxo|voxo%% (*vah*-shah) (shoot!) (woah!)
- %%ni|ni%% %%küu|küu%% %%lö|lö%% %%löizök|löizök%% (mah *koo*-wuh loh *loy*-choke) (Let's go!)

## Pronunciation

Learning how to pronounce the words requires learning how each of the 24
phonemes work and how they combine to form syllables. Each translation has a
wide array of acceptable alternatives that you can use if certain sounds are too
challenging. The distance between each sound can be subtle in certain words and
with certain speakers but the words were chosen in such a way that there
shouldn't be words that have a nearby pronunciation which would be too difficult
to differentiate.
