# Introduction

## What is Hisyëö?

A constructed language for people around the world to communicate with each
other. Hisyëö is designed using these principles:
- **Neutrality**, words are sourced from all world languages proportional to the
square root of their world population of L1 speakers. Many people who would come
to learn Hisyëö may have a small anchor of familiarity within the lexicon.
Additionally, the grammar is considered an analytic isolating language like its
forebears [Kokanu](https://www.kokanu.com/) and [Toki
Pona](https://tokipona.org). Analytic isolating languages like these remove the
mutation of words by making grammatical syntax separate particle words. The
grammar design is considered a *semi-exception* to the neutrality principle  due
to the requirement that a language has a cohesive grammatical system with a set
of standard conventions (and also partly due to the other pricniple of
expressivity necessitated there being some additional grammar added). That said,
the grammar helps to make Hisyëö less ambiguous overall which supports the
neutrality principle indirectly in some respects.
- **Succinctness**, words are kept to a minimum where possible but information
density is strongly emphasized so that the language can still be used for
translations of scientific and artistic media. This principle is not the same as
the more strict principle of *minimalism* in that it is meant to allow for
including singular words from (1) concepts that appear in a multitude of
conversations and (2) concepts that would need complex nested clauses that can
otherwise derail a sentence from comprehension due to the added working memory
to develop an understanding of the sentence. Careful consideration is made that
the semantic spaces that each individual word covers do not overlap other words
although there will be times where you can build a similar concept by using
compound phrases and this is okay and even useful for providing additional ways
to clarify.
- **Expressivity**, the language is designed to be highly expressive in its word
and grammar choices. With just over 800 words, there's a lot more ways to
express feelings, emotions, objects, actions and anything else you can think of.
Additionally, the grammar has been enhanced to allow for less ambiguous handling
of tense, aspect, mood, causation, and volition. The language has been tested
against a multitude of translation media to confirm that no concept is too
challenging or too verbose to express.

Some of these principles and the language features that you will learn may seem
contrary to the practices of any self respecting [International Auxiliary
Language](http://interlanguages.net). Hisyëö does not strictly follow the
tradional principles. Too much effort within IAL development is spent on
regularization and cherrypicking existing lexical and grammatical tactics of
natural languages (while applying some first language bias regardless of the
best intentions). Instead, Hisyëö pushes closer to an
[artlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_language) or a
[loglang](https://loglangs.wiki/Portal) by focusing less on ease-of-learning and
instead striving for a more complete linguistic system.

:::caution International Auxiliary Languages

It is the belief of the Hisyëö creators that the mission of an IAL to be a
widely adopted secondary language for everyone, is both farfetched and even
slightly dangerous--is purity of values enough to counteract the viral, or
rather *colonial*, nature of practicing a non-local language in the public or on
the internet? Hisyëö accepts its place as a showpiece of absurdity by being both
serious and artistic. It isn't designed with the intention of acquiring all
world speakers but we hope that Hisyëö's cultural identity and ethos will draw
the right people to carve out a small piece of universe for us.

## Where did Hisyëö come from?

Hisyëö was borne out of a desire from a member of the Kokanu community to grow
Kokanu into something that could truly be versatile enough to be used for
translations of popular media, scientific papers and philosophical treateses.
Unfortunately for him, the Kokanu community intends the language to be as
minimalist as possible and so the density of information when translating is not
a consideration. Neither translation of media nor scientific communication are
goals of the language. Having spent considerable time becoming fluent in Kokanu
and being inspired by a new kokanido
([koanu](https://www.parallax.net.nz/x/koanu/)) at the time, this Kokanu
community member decided to try to create his own kokanido, enhancing it with
some ideas taken from other constructed and natural languages.

## The Basics

Now that you understand why and where Hisyëö came from, let's learn enough to
write a few basic sentences.

### Sounds

*Contains US English example words.*

#### Vowels
- o as in sl**o**t or f**a**ther
- ö as in r**o**pe or Camb**o**dia
- e as in b**e**d or c**a**t
- ë as in m**a**y or f**a**ce
- ı as in c**i**ty or w**i**ll
- i as in happ**y** or c**ei**ling
- u as in r**u**n or en**ou**gh
- ü as in l**o**se, thr**ou**gh

#### Consonants
- h as in **h**am or **h**old
- k as in **c**up or sti**ck**
- g as in **g**old or sna**g**
- t as in **t**ip or pu**tt**
- z as in **ch**ore or na**t**ure
- s as in mi**s**t or i**c**e
- x as in a**sh** or ra**t**ion
- d as in **d**ig or ba**d** 
- ȷ as in **j**og or a**g**e
- p as in **p**oke or si**p**
- v as in **v**alid or ga**v**el
- m as in la**m**b or **m**ineral
- n as in **n**od or ba**n**
- w as in **w**eep or a**w**ake
- l as in **l**inger or ba**ll**ad
- y as in **y**earn or ma**y**o

### Rules

1. Words do not ever mutate, special particles are used to introduce phrases of
   the sentence.
2. Verbs, nouns, and modifiers (adjectives/adverbs) can be used as each other
   depending on what role they play in the sentence.
3. There is no word for "the".
4. The basic structure of a sentence is (in any order) one verb phrase and any
   amount of additional noun phrases.
5. If the verb prhase is placed as the first constituent of a sentence, then the
   particle that introduces the phrase can be omitted.

### Usage

Some basic words to get you started on sentence construction.

Choose a subject (preceded by %%ü@ü%%):
- %%noyo@noyo%% (I)
- %%nimü@nimü%% (you)
- %%ni@ni%% (we)
- %%loı@loı%% (it/they)

Choose a verb (preceded by %%lı@lı%% or omitted if first):
- %%köto@köto%% (to say)
- %%monodo@monodo%% (to meet)
- %%mokon@mokon%% (to eat)
- %%vısun@vısun%% (to know)

Choose an object (preceded by %%cö@cö%%):
- %%ulyö@ulyö%% (that)
- %%küöxı@küöxı%% (fruit)
- %%pioli@pioli%% (hello) 
- %%sütüö@sütüö%% (friend)

Choose a sentence ender:
- %%lötven@lötven%% (polite)
- %%voxo@voxo%% (surprise)
- %%ko@ko%% (question)
- %%löicök@löicök%% (confirmation)
- or none

Now, make a sentence...
- %%ü@ü%% %%noyo@noyo%% %%lı@lı%% %%mokon@mokon%% %%cö@cö%% %%küöxı@küöxı%% (I eat fruit)
- %%vısun@vısun%% %%ü@ü%% %%nimü@nimü%% %%cö@cö%% %%sütüö@sütüö%% %%ko@ko%% (Do you know a friend?)
