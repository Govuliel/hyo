# Introduction

## What is Hisyëö?

A language for international communication that is designed using these principles:
- **Neutrality**, words are sourced from all world languages proportional to the square
root of their world population of L1 speakers. The grammar, however, picked a side
(analytic isolating) due to the origin of the language. There may be some things
that will feel unintuitive to some L2 learners but this is inevitable and unavoidable.
- **Succinctness**, words are kept to a minimum where possible but information density
is strongly considered so that the language can still be used for translations of
popular media.
- **Expressivity**, the language is designed to be highly expressive and has been tested
against a multitude of translation media to confirm that no concept is too challenging
or too verbose to express.
- **Experimentality**, the grammar has had a few slightly radical alterations that make it
more expressive but at the cost of being alien compared to most common grammatical
facilities especially amongst [International Auxiliary Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_auxiliary_language) (IALs). Despite aspirations of
being used internationally, no grammatical feature will be removed to ease learning.

Some of these principles and the language features that you will learn may seem contrary
to the min-max tradition of IAL design but that is part of the point: too much effort within
IAL development is spent on regularization of existing grammatical tactics of natural
languages. Hisyëö bucks that trend and tries to go the fun route. After all, the world
won't bend for more of what they already have—even if it is simpler.

## Where did Hisyëö come from?

Hisyëö was borne out of a desire from a Kokanu manager to grow the language into something
that could truly be versatile enough to be used for scientific papers and philosophical
treateses. Despite a small group of interested Kokanauts, the majority of the community
didn't want the added volume of words that might be only usable in certain contexts.
Kokanu is intended to be used for "basic communication" and this realization was the 
primary driver for the split.

### Rules

1. Words do not ever mutate, special particles are used to organize the sentence.
2. Verbs, nouns, and modifiers (adjectives/adverbs) can be
used as each other depending on what role they play in the sentence.
3. There is no word for "the" or "a/an".
4. The basic structure of a sentence is (in any order) one verb phrase and any
amount of additional noun phrases.

### Usage

Some basic words to get you started on sentence construction.

Choose a subject (preceded by ü):
- noyo (I)
- nimö (you)
- mo (we)
- loı (it/they)

Choose a verb (preceded by lı):
- köto (to say)
- monodo (to meet)
- mokon (to eat)
- vısun (to know)

Choose an object (preceded by zö):
- uyö (that)
- küöxi (fruit)
- pioli (hello) 
- sütüö (friend)

Choose a sentence ender:
- lötven (polite)
- voxo (surprise)
- ko (question)
- löizök (confirmation)
- or none

Now, make a sentence...
- ü noyo lı mokon zö küöxi (I eat fruit)
- ü nimö lı wısun zö sütüö ko (Do you know a friend?)
