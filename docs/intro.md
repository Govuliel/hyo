# Introduction

## What is Hisyëö?

A language for people around the world to communicate with each other. Hisyëö is
designed using these principles:
- **Neutrality**, words are sourced from all world languages proportional to the
square root of their world population of L1 speakers. Many people who would come
to learn Hisyëö may have a small anchor of familiarity within the lexicon.
Additionally, the grammar is considered an analytic isolating language like it's
forebears [Kokanu](https://www.kokanu.com/) and [Toki
Pona](https://tokipona.org). The grammar is largely based on Kokanu's (which
bears some resemblance to *its* forebear, Toki Pona) but a few things have been
tweaked and a more complete particle system implemented. The grammar design is
considered an *exception* to the neutrality principle in order to give enough
leverage to the other guiding principles. That said, the grammar helps to make
Hisyëö less ambiguous overall which supports the neutrality principle
indirectly.
- **Succinctness**, words are kept to a minimum where possible but information
density is strongly emphasized so that the language can still be used for
translations of popular media. This principle is not the same as the more strict
principle of *minimalism* in that it is meant to allow for including singular
words from (1) concepts that appear in a multitude of conversations and (2)
concepts that would need complex nested clauses that can otherwise derail a
sentence from comprehension due to the added working memory to develop an
understanding of the sentence.
- **Expressivity**, the language is designed to be highly expressive in its word
and grammar choices. With around 800 words, there's a lot more ways to express
feelings, emotions, objects, actions and anything else you can think of. The
language has been tested against a multitude of translation media to confirm
that no concept is too challenging or too verbose to express. Additionally, the
grammar has been enhanced to allow for less ambiguous handling of tense, aspect,
mood, causation, and volition.

Some of these principles and the language features that you will learn may seem
contrary to the traditions of [IAL](http://interlanguages.net) design but that
is part of the point: too much effort within IAL development is spent on
regularization and cherrypicking existing lexical and grammatical tactics of
natural languages. Instead, Hisyëö pushes closer to a
[loglang](https://loglangs.wiki/Portal) by focusing less on ease-of-learning and
more on the principles above. The dream of wide adoption of an IAL is both
farfetched and dangerous; Hisyëö is intended to celebrate the diversity of
linguistic phenomena and not supplant any local languages.

## Where did Hisyëö come from?

Hisyëö was borne out of a desire from a member of the Kokanu community to grow
Kokanu into something that could truly be versatile enough to be used for
translations of popular media, scientific papers and philosophical treateses.
Unfortunately for me, the Kokanu community intends the language to be as
minimalist as possible and so the density of information when translating is not
a consideration. Neither translation of media nor scientific communication are
goals of the language. Having spent considerable time becoming fluent in Kokanu,
I wanted to use it as the core of my own language and enhance it with some of my
own ideas.

## The Basics

Now that you understand why and where Hisyëö came from, let's learn enough to
write a few basic sentences.

### Sounds

*Contains US English example words.*

#### Vowels
- o as in sl**o**t or f**a**ther
- ö as in r**ou**pe or Camb**o**dia
- e as in b**e**d or c**a**t
- ë as in m**a**y or f**a**ce
- ı as in c**i**ty or w**i**ll
- i as in happ**y** or c**ei**ling
- u as in r**u**n or en**ou**gh
- ü as in l**o**se, thr**ou**gh

#### Consonants
- h as in **h**am or **h**old
- k as in **c**up or sti**ck**
- g as in **g**old or sna**g**
- t as in **t**ip or pu**tt**
- z as in **ch**ore or na**t**ure
- s as in mi**s**t or i**c**e
- x as in a**sh** or ra**t**ion
- d as in **d**ig or ba**d** 
- ȷ as in **j**og or a**g**e
- p as in **p**oke or si**p**
- v as in **v**alid or ga**v**el
- m as in la**m**b or **m**ineral
- n as in **n**od or ba**n**
- w as in **w**eep or a**w**ake
- l as in **l**inger or ba**ll**ad
- y as in **y**earn or ma**y**o

### Rules

1. Words do not ever mutate, special particles are used to introduce phrases of
   the sentence.
2. Verbs, nouns, and modifiers (adjectives/adverbs) can be used as each other
   depending on what role they play in the sentence.
3. There is no word for "the".
4. The basic structure of a sentence is (in any order) one verb phrase and any
   amount of additional noun phrases.
5. If the verb prhase is placed as the first constituent of a sentence, then the
   particle that introduces the phrase can be omitted.

### Usage

Some basic words to get you started on sentence construction.

Choose a subject (preceded by %%ü@ü%%):
- %%noyo@noyo%% (I)
- %%nimü@nimü%% (you)
- %%ni@ni%% (we)
- %%loı@loı%% (it/they)

Choose a verb (preceded by %%lı@lı%% or omitted):
- %%köto@köto%% (to say)
- %%monodo@monodo%% (to meet)
- %%mokon@mokon%% (to eat)
- %%vısun@vısun%% (to know)

Choose an object (preceded by %%cö@cö%%):
- %%ulyö@ulyö%% (that)
- %%küöxı@küöxı%% (fruit)
- %%pioli@pioli%% (hello) 
- %%sütüö@sütüö%% (friend)

Choose a sentence ender:
- %%lötven@lötven%% (polite)
- %%voxo@voxo%% (surprise)
- %%ko@ko%% (question)
- %%löicök@löicök%% (confirmation)
- or none

Now, make a sentence...
- %%ü@ü%% %%noyo@noyo%% %%lı@lı%% %%mokon@mokon%% %%cö@cö%% %%küöxı@küöxı%% (I eat fruit)
- %%vısun@vısun%% %%ü@ü%% %%nimü@nimü%% %%cö@cö%% %%sütüö@sütüö%% %%ko@ko%% (Do you know a friend?)
