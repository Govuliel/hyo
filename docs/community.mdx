# Community

So, you've decided that you might actually share our excitement for the future
or you just find our living future events cool. Now you're actually considering
joining in on the shenanigans? Well, read on!

## How can I join the community?

The Discord community is currently reserved for Hisyëö speakers only. You cannot
be a member until you have learned the language. There is only currently one way
gain access to the official Discord community:

> Learn the language and carry on a full conversation with one of the existing
> community members.

Just carrying out a simple conversation will not be enough. You must be:
- respectful
- creative, thoughtful, or kind
- not overly interested in critical analyis ([Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect))
- interested in being an **active** participant in a growing community that
    - plays video and board games
    - creates literary, musical, or visual works of art
    - translates all kinds of existing works
    - supports planetary health through community action
    - raises awareness of our language and community
    - has endless conversations in Hisyëö

*The community is not intended to be a public space, instead it's closer to a
private club.* There are many public places where criticism and feedback can be
offered. We're not looking to be another open space for language nerds to
express their distaste—or admiration, for that matter. We are seeking to apply
tried-and-true community-building principles to create something greater than
just another conlang. 

In addition to this enterprise, we also seek to grow the language in the public
domain. A set of courses and tests are being developed that follow the six
levels of the
[CEFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages)
standard. Eventually, some of lower course certificates and tests will replace
the manually-curated community priveleges.

## Where can I meet existing community members?

Here is the list of locations where we hope to have Hisyëans available to chat
with:

- Telegram
- Reddit
- Matrix
- Mastodon
- YouTube 
- GitHub Discussions

:::warning Not Yet Created
Currently, none of these public spaces are setup. Please bear with us as this is
alpha cultureware.
:::

Even if you don't plan on learning Hisyëö, we'd love to have
a chat with you in one of these public spaces!

## I'd like to contribute

We'd love for you to join our mission! There are outstanding tickets in various
projects in our GitHub organization. There are also numerous public domain works
that can be translated and, if you're interested, hosted in this site. We'd also
be glad to link to content hosted elsewhere.

Bringing more people to the language and community is also appreciated. After
acquiring some experience in speaking the language, an interview can be
requested for them to meet with one of our community leaders.

## Why so draconian?

Because we feel that like many creatures on Earth, new life is often very
fragile before becoming strong enough to thrive. A community and culture is just
the same. Once we've established a strong core of active members we'll open the
community up for folks who want to use the ongoing conversations for
comprehensible input.

## How can I help support financially?

We are currently looking into ways we can begin fundraising.
