- For all phonemes, there is some flexibility in the position, voicing, aspiration, etc. to accommodate learners who speak languages that may pronounce these sounds differently
- Words beginning with a vowel can begin with or without a glottal stop [ʔ] pronounced, at the discretion of the speaker.
- The coda-/n/ can be realized as (1) nasalization of the preceding vowel, (2) it can assimilate to the position of the following sound, i.e. /n/ → [m, n, ɲ, ŋ, ɴ] based on the position of the following or (3) coda-/n/ is pronounced [n] in all places.
- The coda-/k/ is often realized without any audible release [k̚]
- The coda-/t/ is often realized without any audible release [t̚]
- The /h/ is often realized as [x] when preceding /i/ or /u/ vowels.


### Vowels

| Hisyëö | Latin | IPA | Transliteration Sources |
|:---:|:---:|-----|----------------------------------------------|
|      | ⟨o⟩ | /ɑ/ | unrounded open vowels: a ɑ ɐ                   |
| ⟨ ı ⟩ | ⟨ö⟩ | /o/ | rounded open/back vowels: ɶ ɒ ɞ ɔ o ɵ         |
| ⟨ ʃ ⟩ | ⟨u⟩ | /ə/ | unrounded central/back open-mid vowels: ə ʌ ɤ |
| ⟨ ʄ ⟩ | ⟨ü⟩ | /u/ | close back vowels: u ʉ ʊ ɯ                   |
| ⟨ ȷ ⟩ | ⟨ı⟩ | /ɪ/ | front/central close/close-mid vowels: ɪ ʏ ɨ   |
| ⟨ ɟ ⟩ | ⟨i⟩ | /i/ | front/central close vowels: i y              |
| ⟨ ɿ ⟩ | ⟨e⟩ | /ɛ/ | unrounded open-mid vowels: ɛ ɜ æ               |
| ⟨ ʇ ⟩ | ⟨ë⟩ | /e/ | front/central close-mid vowels: e ɘ ø         |

## Phonotactics

Syllable structure is (C)V(C) where only these codas are allowed:
- /k/
- /t/
- / t͡ɕ/
- /s/
- /n/
- /l/

All codas cannot be followed by their same phoneme as the onset of the next
syllable. There are also some additional instances where certain onsets are not
allowed following certain codas:
- coda-/k/ cannot be followed by onset-/g/
- coda-/t/ cannot be followed by onset-/d/
- coda-/ t͡ɕ/ cannot be followed by onset-/s/
- coda-/s/ cannot be followed by onset-/ʃ/

## Prosody

In two syllable words, the stress is placed on the first syllable regardless of
the vowels present. That being said, strong vowels are slightly geminated
compared to the weak vowels.

|         |           Strong           |      Weak     |
|---------|:--------------------------:|:-------------:|
| Abugida | (null), ⟨ı⟩, ⟨ʄ⟩, ⟨ɟ⟩, ⟨ʇ⟩ | ⟨ʃ⟩, ⟨ȷ⟩, ⟨ɿ⟩ |
| Latin   |   ⟨o⟩, ⟨ö⟩, ⟨ü⟩, ⟨i⟩, ⟨ë⟩  | ⟨u⟩, ⟨ı⟩, ⟨e⟩ |

In three syllable words, stress is placed on the second syllable if the first
vowel is weak and the second syllable is strong.

Either an unvoiced pause or a voiced hu are used to mark the ending of a ta- or
te-clause.

There are no specific filler words in Kokanu

## Word restrictions

All of the dictionary words of Hisyëö (not including proper nouns or loanwords, etc.) are either one-, two- or three-syllables long. There are no minimal pairs that contrast using any “conflicting phonemes”.

### Consonant Conflicts
- /p/ with /v/ and /m/
- /k/ with /h/ and /g/
- /g/ with /h/, /k/, and /d/
- /t/ with /d/, /z/, /s/, and /n/
- /z/ with /ȷ/, /t/
- /d/ with /t/ and /g/
- /ȷ/ with /z/
- /s/ with /v/, /z/, and /t/
- /x/ with /s/ and /v/
- /v/ with /s/, /x/, and /p/
- /h/ with Ø, /k/, and /g/
- /m/ with /n/ and /p/
- /n/ with /m/ and /t/
- Ø (null onset) with /h/
- /w/ with Ø
- /l/ with /y/
- /y/ with Ø and /l/

### Vowel Conflicts
- /o/ with /u/,           
- /e/ with /ı/ and /u/    
- /ı/ with /o/, /i/, and /ë/
- /u/ with /o/, /ö/, and /e/
- /ö/ with /ü/ and /u/
- /ë/ with /ı/ and /i/
- /i/ with /ë/ and /ı/
- /ü/ with /ö/

This means that two words that differ by one sound cannot have any of these conflicting phonemes as the differing sounds. For example, since %%yözno|yözno%% is a Hisyëö word, there are no words like yözmo, yözto or özno also in the language because they differ by one phoneme that conflicts with a phoneme in %%yözno|yözno%%.
