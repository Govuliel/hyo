# Sentences

The structure of morphemes, phrases and sentence constituents.

## Morphosyntactics

Hisyëö is called an [isolating
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language) because all words
are a single morpheme. A morpheme is a single unit of meaning. In English, the
word "cat" is a single morpheme but the word "cats" is two morphemes: "cat" +
"s" where the "s" is the morpheme that signifies that a noun is plural. The word
"intwined" is three morphemes, "in" for the meaning of *interconnectedness*,
"twine" for the verb that means to wrap or weave with a twine-like object, and
"ed" for the past participle of the verb (the modifier form in past tense). Some
examples of isolating languages are
[Yoruba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_language#Grammar),
[Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_grammar), and
[Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language#Grammar).

Hisyëö is also considered an [analytic
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_language), which means that
prepositions, particles and modifiers are used to provide the additional meaning
to words instead of adding prefixes and affixes to words. English is mostly an
analytic language although there are some instances of affixes (such as "-ed",
"-ing", "-s"). There are no prefixes and affices in Hisyëö, all meaning is
provided via words and prepositions and particles.

### Constituent Word Order

The order with which you setup a clause or sentence is called [constituent
order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_order#Constituent_word_orders).
Sentences are made up of verb and noun phrases that exist within prepositional
phrases. Let's ignore what prepositional phrases are available for the time
being and just zoom out and think about subject phrases (with noun phrases
within), action phrases (with verb phrases within), and semantic phrases (with
noun phrases within). Many languages require that you order your sentence in a
particular way such that each element along the way can be understood as a
paritcular part of the sentence. Some of the most popular constituent orders
that occur in natural languages include:
[subject-object-verb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb_word_order),
[subject-verb-object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object_word_order),
[verb-second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V2_word_order), and
[topic-comment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_and_comment). In addition to
these sentence structure types, there also exists some languages that have no
strict word order. Instead they use morphological elements to identify the
different parts of the sentence. In these languages, the order in which the
parts of a sentence are provided may indicate the theme or theme of a sentence
as well.

Hisyëö has a free constituent order because all sentence parts are marked by a
preposition. From a topic-comment lens, the order of your sentence puts the
first provided element as the topic and the rest as successively less important
comments about the topic. That said, there is one preferred ordering because there
is one preposition that can be elided (skipped): the %%lı@lı%% realis verb marker.
This marker precedes the main action of the sentence and specifically an action
that is definitely occurring or has occurred. Because of this elision rule,
sentences are often either
[verb-subject-object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object_word_order)
or
[verb-object-subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93subject_word_order).

### Phrase Word Order

Within any given phrase there is always one word that is the main contents of that
noun or verb phrase. This is known as the [nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(linguistics)) of the phrase.
In some languages the nucleus is the first word and in other languages the nucleus is the last
word in a phrase. The nucleus of an action phrase is a verb, the nucleus of a subject
or semantic phrase is a noun. Hisyëö has a nucleus in the middle of a phrase (it *is* a nucleus, after all).
Determiners go to the left of the nucleus and modifiers to the right.

## Sentence Types

### Simple

A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause with no dependent
clauses.

### Compound

A compound sentence consists of multiple independent clauses with no dependent
clauses. These clauses are joined together using conjunctions.

### Complex

A complex sentence consists of one independent clause and at least one dependent
clause.

### Compound-Complex

A compound–complex sentence (or complex–compound sentence) consists of multiple
independent clauses, at least one of which has at least one dependent clause.

## Speech Acts

### Assertives
Speech acts that commit a speaker to the truth of the expressed proposition
### Directives
Speech acts that are to cause the hearer to take a particular action, e.g.
requests, commands and advice
### Commissives
Speech acts that commit a speaker to some future action, e.g. promises and oaths
### Expressives
Speech acts that express on the speaker's attitudes and emotions towards the
proposition, e.g. congratulations, excuses and thanks
### Declarations
Speech acts that change the reality in accord with the proposition of the
declaration, e.g. baptisms, pronouncing someone guilty or pronouncing someone
husband and wife
