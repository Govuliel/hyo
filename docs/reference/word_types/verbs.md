# Verbs

A type of word that represents an action.

## Prepositions

### Realis

The most basic form of verbal preposition is the realis form. If you start your
sentence with this form of verb, you don't need to have a leading particle. 
However, if you are adding another realis verb to the sentence or you placed the
some other preposition in the leading position of the sentence, then you must
use the realis verb marker (%%lı@lı%%/%%ʓȷ@lı%%) to introduce the verb.

### Irrealis

There are a few different irrealis verb markers that allow for a variety of
different moods indicating that the predicate has not occurred (or isn't known
to have). 

#### Epistemic (*what could be*)

This irrealis verb marker (%%köi@köi%%/%%ɔıɽɟ@köi%%) indicates that the
predicate *could* or *might* happen. This marker tells you that the
speaker/writer either believes or has knowledge that the predicate may occur but
isn't confident that this future reality is assured or that the possibility of
it occurring doesn't necessitate that it will be.

#### Conditional (*what would be*)

The conditional verb marker (%%pit@pit%%/%%ʋ̆ɟ@pit%%) indicates that the
predicate occurring is dependent on some other circumstance that is either
explicitly described or implied.

#### Deontic (*what should be*)

Finally, we have the deontic verb marker (%%küu@küu%%/%%ɔʄɽʃ@küu%%) which is
indicates that the writer/speaker believes the predicate should or ought to be
happen.

### Future

There is a form of verbal preposition that is on a slightly different dimension
from the realis/irrealis verb markers above. Instead of delineating the mood of
the sentence, this marker indicates that the predicate will occur in the future.
This marker (%%ke@ke%%/%%ɔɿ@ke%%) indicates what linguists call the **future
tense**.
