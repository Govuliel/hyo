# Enders

A type of word that ends a clause or a sentence.

## Clause Enders

Currently the only clause ender is the comma and it's treated as slight pause in
spoken language. This is different from Kokanu because many of the approximately
56% of words that do not exist in Kokanu, where chosen so that they reduce the
need for inner clauses. This may be re-evaluated at a later date.

## Sentence Enders

There are many sentence enders in Hisyëö unlike Kokanu. These allow Hisyëö
speakers to properly express what could be considered as "registers" in that
they change the overall tone of what is being said. The content remains the same,
but the meaning is changed considerably.
