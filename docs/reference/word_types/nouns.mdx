# Nouns

A type of word that represents an entity (tangible or intangible). Can be
represented by a Noun Phrase (NP) which contains a nucleus and surrounding
quantifiers and modifiers.

## Roles

### Causer / Voluntary Subject

The %%ü@ü%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role represents the *causer*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the agent or experiencer of the action.
The nature of this role is that the noun phrase is making the choice to commit
the act of their own free will. 

### Causee / Involuntary Subject

The %%ölë@ölë%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role will represent the *causee*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the agent or experiencer of the action.
The nature of this role is that the noun phrase is **not** making the choice to
commit the act of their own free will. Either they are bound/forced to do so or
they do not have the wherewithal to make a conscious choice on the matter and
are acting out of some basic instinst.

### Patient, Theme, Stimulus (Direct Object)

The %%cö@cö%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for transitive verbs that have an additional argument. The
argument represents a patient (an entity that undergoes the action and changes
state), a theme (an entity that undergoes the action but does not change state),
or a stimulus (an entity that prompts sensory or emotional feeling). In English,
this represents some of the senses of the word "to" and "into", however, often
times there is no preceding particle for this argument.

### Instrument or Manner

The %%vio@vio%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent some entity that was used to carry out
the action. It can also represent the way or manner with which the action was
carried out. In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "with",
"using", and "via".

### Location or Time

The %%hoi@hoi%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where or when the action occurs. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the words "in", "at", and "on".

### Direction or Destination (Indirect Object)

The %%müt@müt%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action is directed towards.
In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "to", "into", and
"towards".

### Source or Origin

The %%sün@sün%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action originated. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "from".

### Beneficiary or Purpose

The %%oxon@oxon%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent for whose benefit the action occurs or
the reason for the action. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "for".

### Cause

The %%nënko@nënko%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent what caused the action to occur or a
past reason that led to the action. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "because".

### Collaborator

The %%ovek@ovek%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent a fellow actor that is also engaged in
the same action as the subject. However, the NP is not considered a subject of
the sentence. In English, this represents some of the senses of the word
"with".

### Context or Condition

The %%win@win%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent an overarching topic, contextual
detail, or a condition for the underlying sentence. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the words "regarding", "given", "as for", and "when".

### Counter-Agent

The %%dën@dën%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that either represent a special kind of goal/agent for
verbs that indicates an opposing agent for verbs that indicate an action that is
*oppositional* (where both sides are engaging in an opposing action). In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "against".

### Evidence

The %%üc@üc%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent proof or an information source that the
specified action is known or believed to have occurred, is occurring, or will
occur. In English, this represents some of the senses of the phrase "or so".

### Distance or Duration

The %%lon@lon%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent the time or space that the action
occurs within. This role is related to the location/time role but it represents
finite physical space or actual time periods. In English, this represents some
of the senses of the word "for".

### Intermediate

The %%gıtno@gıtno%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for either a NP that represents the a time or physical entity
that the action occurs between or a conjunction of two NPs that represent two
boundaries in time or space that the action occurs between. In English, this
represents some of the senses of the word "between".

### Genitive

The %%yë@yë%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for a NP that is describing the preceding noun or verb phrase
in some contextually dependent manner. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "of".

## From...

Converting from the other content types into nouns.

### Verbs

When a verb acts as a noun, it represents an archetypal object that has been or
hasn't yet been involved in the happening of that verb action. Like "-able" in
English but also there are many terms that English has to refer to these
entities already. These are direct objects, patients and themes that would be
logical to use in a sentence where you use that verb.

### Modifiers

When a modifier acts as a noun, it means an uncountable quality and/or degree of
being a given state. Like the affix "-ness" in English. One way of making a noun
out of a modifier is to provide it as the nucleus of a preposition phrase.
Preposition particles always take the word is immediately following it as a noun
derivation of that word and it is the nucleus of the preposition phrase.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-kon-cukto" queryString>
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%pön@pön%% %%ü@ü%% %%wölık@wölık%% %%cö@cö%% %%küyö@küyö%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
    %%ʋ̃ı@pön%% %%ɽʄ@ü%% %%ʒıʓ̑ȷ@wölık%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%ɔʄɀı@küyö%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Another way is to create a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier with the
%%yë@yë%% particle. This particle means that whatever word type that the word
immediately following it is, take the noun derivation of that word type.

This is especially useful for the typical reason that genitive phrases are
useful: it allows you to describe a quality with some modifiers of its own. One
of the most common usages is when adding a degree to a modifier:

<Tabs groupId="popöun-kon-cukto" queryString>
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%töxücı@töxücı%% %%pümi@pümi%% %%yë@yë%% %%ıwotë@ıwotë%% %%ëto@ëto%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
    %%cıɋʄꞇȷ@töxücı%% %%ʋʄƶɟ@pümi%% %%ɀʇ@yë%% %%ɽȷʒcʇ@ıwotë%% %%ɽʇc@ëto%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Since Hisyëö has less than 800 words, using genitive phrases with modifiers
allows you to create more complex phrases that would require several sentences
to formulate otherwise. 

## Noun Clauses

A noun can be concrete or abstract, it doesn't have to be some physical entity
or even a finite state. It can be a process or really anything that you might
want to refer to and use as a subject or object of a sentence. In Hisyëö, you
can create these complex nouns by building sentences within a special clause
called a **Noun Clause**. In order to create one of these clauses, you must
start with a particle. There are two special words available that can be used
to introduce a noun clause:

<Tabs groupId="popöun-kon-cukto" queryString>
    <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
        <ol>
          <li>%%do@do%% - Use this one for infinitives and gerunds</li>
          <li>%%vos@vos%% - Use this one for complete inner sentences</li>
        </ol>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
        <ol>
          <li>%%ʌ@do%% - Use this one for infinitives and gerunds</li>
          <li>%%ɤ́@vos%% - Use this one for complete inner sentences</li>
        </ol>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After this particle, you start your sentence. In the infinitive/gerund form, you
do not provide an agent/experiencer (subject) of the sentence because this is
the nature of how infinitives are used: a noun that refers to the meaning
expressed by the inner sentence but referred holisitically as an object in the
outer sentence.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-kon-cukto" queryString>
    <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
        %%ëo@ëo%% %%govon@govon%% %%ölë@ölë%% %%noyo@noyo%% %%ü@ü%% <strong>%%do@do%%</strong> %%cöüvon@cöüvon%% %%cö@cö%% %%micin@micin%%. "to cook fish makes me disgusted"
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
        %%ɽʇɽ@ëo%% %%ꜿɤ̃@govon%% %%ɽıʓʇ@ölë%% %%ƨɀ@noyo%% %%ɽʄ@ü%% <strong>%%ʌ@do%%</strong> %%ꞇıɽʄɤ̃@cöüvon%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%micin@micin%%. "to cook fish makes me disgusted"
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution Beware the similarity between gerunds and the abstract particle

While these noun clause gerunds are very useful, you must be careful to discern
the distinction of meaning between the gerund usage of a noun clause leading
particle and the abstract particle preceding a content word. The abstract form
should be thought of as "acts of" or "matters of" which should be seen as more
of a loose relationship than using a noun clause as a gerund. "acts/matters of
eating meat" means something different from "eating meat".

<Tabs groupId="popöun-kon-cukto" queryString>
    <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
        <p>%%toüyen@toüyen%% %%ü@ü%% %%noyo@noyo%% %%cö@cö%% %%do@do%% %%mokon@mokon%% %%cö@cö%% %%oksün@oksün%%.</p>
        <p>%%toüyen@toüyen%% %%ü@ü%% %%noyo@noyo%% %%cö@cö%% %%kon@kon%% %%mokon@mokon%% %%oksün@oksün%%.</p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
        <p>%%cɽʄɀ̃ɿ@toüyen%% %%ɽʄ@ü%% %%ƨɀ@noyo%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%ʌ@do%% %%ƶɔ̃@mokon%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%ɽ̑ɐɟɽ́ı@oksiös%%.</p>
        <p>%%cɽʄɀ̃ɿ@toüyen%% %%ɽʄ@ü%% %%ƨɀ@noyo%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%ɔ̃@kon%% %%ƶɔ̃@mokon%% %%ɽ̑ɐɟɽ́ı@oksiös%%.</p>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The first sentence implies that the speaker hates specifically the act of eating
meat whereas the second sentence implies that the speaker hates matters of meat
eating altogether which broadens the hate to the act of discussing or thinking
about it. 

:::

The other form of noun phrase includes a subject or if one is not provided then
it should be intepreted as "there is" or "it is" depending on the predicate that
is provided. This form of noun phrase is useful when you need to introduce a
clause that changes the subject from the underlying sentence. Some verbs
primarily are used with some form of noun clause as their object and this form
allows for a complete sentence to be included as that object.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-kon-cukto" queryString>
    <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
        <p>%%völun@völun%% %%ü@ü%% %%noyo@noyo%% %%cö@cö%% %%vos@vos%% %%völun@völun%% %%ü@ü%% %%nimü@nimü%% %%cö@cö%% %%noyo@noyo%% "I want you to want me"</p>
        <p>%%xiwon@xiwon%% %%ü@ü%% %%noyo@noyo%% %%cö@cö%% %%vos@vos%% %%suhot@suhot%% %%tiü@tiü%% "I wish that it was 5 o'clock</p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
        <p>%%ɤıʓ̃ʃ@völun%% %%ɽʄ@ü%% %%ƨɀ@noyo%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%ɤ́@vos%% %%ɤıʓ̃ʃ@völun%% %%ɽʄ@ü%% %%ƨɟƶʄ@nimü%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%ƨɀ@noyo%% "I want you to want me"</p>
        <p>%%ɋɟʒ̃@xiwon%% %%ɽʄ@ü%% %%ƨɀ@noyo%% %%ꞇı@cö%% %%ɤ́@vos%% %%ɐʃɂ̆@suhot%% %%cɟɽʄ@tiü%% "I wish that it was 5 o'clock</p>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note English indirect object

The English sentence in the translation above "I want you to want me" is using
an indirect object of "you" and an direct object infinitve phrase of "to want
me". This might seem like the wrong translation since there is a preposition
that Hisyëö typically uses for indirect objects. This is just an example of some
of the irregular grammar around the use of the verb "to want". In Hisyëö, the
best translation is to use a finite noun phrase where the indirect object of the
English sentence is now the subject of the inner noun clause.

There are other uses of these same particles that create noun clauses as
relative clause introducers and you can learn more about those usages in the
Modifiers chapter.
