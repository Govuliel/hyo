# Nouns

## Roles

## Prepositions

### `je`

## From...

Converting from the other content types into nouns.

### Verbs

When a verb acts as a noun, it represents a archetypal object that has been or
hasn't yet been involved in the happening of that verb action. Like "-able" in
English but also there are many terms that English has to refer to these
entities already. These are direct objects, patients and themes that would be
logical to use in a sentence where you use that verb.

### Modifiers

When a modifier acts as a noun, it means an uncountable quality and/or degree of
being a given state. Like the affix "-ness" in English. One way of making a noun
out of a modifier is to provide it as the nucleus of a preposition phrase.
Preposition particles always have whatever word is immediately following it is,
take the noun derivation of that word and that is the nucleus of the preposition
phrase.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-zıkto">
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%pön|pön%% %%ü|ü%% %%wölık|wölık%% %%zö|zö%% %%küyö|küyö%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="onhukızgo" label="ɽ̃ɂʃɔ̄ȷꜿ">
    %%ʋ̃ı|pön%% %%ɽʄ|ü%% %%ʒıʓ̑ȷ|wölık%% %%ꞇı|zö%% %%ɔʄɀı|küyö%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Another way is to create a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier with the
%%yë|yë%% particle. This particle means that whatever word type that the word
immediately following it is, take the noun derivation of that word type.

This is especially useful for the typical reason that genitive phrases are
useful: it allows you to describe a quality with some modifiers of its own.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-zıkto">
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%töxözü|töxözü%% %%pümi|pümi%% %%yë|yë%% %%ıwotë|ıwotë%% %%ëto|ëto%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="onhukızgo" label="ɽ̃ɂʃɔ̄ȷꜿ">
    %%cıɋıꞇʄ|töxözü%% %%ʋʄƶɟ|pümi%% %%ɀʇ|yë%% %%ɽȷʒcʇ|ıwotë%% %%ɽʇc|ëto%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
