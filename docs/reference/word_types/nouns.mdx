# Nouns

A type of word that represents an entity (tangible or intangible). Can be
represented by a Noun Phrase (NP) which contains a nucleus and surrounding
quantifiers and modifiers.

## Roles

### Causer / Voluntary Subject

The %%ü|ü%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role represents the *causer*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the agent or experiencer of the action.
The nature of this role is that the noun phrase is making the choice to commit
the act of their own free will. 

### Causee / Involuntary Subject

The %%ölë|ölë%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role will represent the *causee*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the agent or experiencer of the action.
The nature of this role is that the noun phrase is **not** making the choice to
commit the act of their own free will. Either they are bound/forced to do so or
they do not have the wherewithal to make a conscious choice on the matter and
are acting out of some basic instinst.

### Patient, Theme, Stimulus (Direct Object)

The %%zö|zö%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for transitive verbs that have an additional argument. The
argument represents a patient (an entity that undergoes the action and changes
state), a theme (an entity that undergoes the action but does not change state),
or a stimulus (an entity that prompts sensory or emotional feeling). In English,
this represents some of the senses of the word "to" and "into", however, often
times there is no preceding particle for this argument.

### Instrument or Manner

The %%vio|vio%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent some entity that was used to carry out
the action. It can also represent the way or manner with which the action was
carried out. In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "with",
"using", and "via".

### Location or Time

The %%hoi|hoi%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where or when the action occurs. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the words "in", "at", and "on".

### Direction or Destination (Indirect Object)

The %%müt|müt%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action is directed towards.
In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "to", "into", and
"towards".

### Source or Origin

The %%sün|sün%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action originated. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "from".

### Beneficiary or Purpose

The %%oxon|oxon%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent for whose benefit the action occurs or
the reason for the action. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "for".

### Cause

The %%nënko|nënko%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent what caused the action to occur or a
past reason that led to the action. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "because".

### Collaborator

The %%ovek|ovek%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent a fellow actor that is also engaged in
the same action as the subject. However, the NP is not considered a subject of
the sentence. In English, this represents some of the senses of the word
"with".

### Context or Condition

The %%win|win%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent an overarching topic, contextual
detail, or a condition for the underlying sentence. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the words "regarding", "given", "as for", and "when".

### Recipient or Counter-Agent

The %%didi|didi%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that either represent a special kind of goal/agent for
verbs that indicate a change in ownership/possession or an opposing agent for
verbs that indicate an action that is *oppositional* (where both sides are
engaging in an opposing action). In English, this represents some of the senses
of the words "to", "with", and "against".

### Evidence

The %%üz|üz%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent proof or an information source that the
specified action is known or believed to have occurred, is occurring, or will
occur. In English, this represents some of the senses of the phrase "or so".

### Distance or Duration

The %%lon|lon%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent the time or space that the action
occurs within. This role is related to the location/time role but it represents
finite physical space or actual time periods. In English, this represents some
of the senses of the word "for".

### Intermediate

The %%gıtno|gıtno%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for either a NP that represents the a time or physical entity
that the action occurs between or a conjunction of two NPs that represent two
boundaries in time or space that the action occurs between. In English, this
represents some of the senses of the word "between".

### Genitive

The %%yë|yë%% particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for a NP that is describing the preceding noun or verb phrase
in some contextually dependent manner. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "of".

## From...

Converting from the other content types into nouns.

### Verbs

When a verb acts as a noun, it represents a archetypal object that has been or
hasn't yet been involved in the happening of that verb action. Like "-able" in
English but also there are many terms that English has to refer to these
entities already. These are direct objects, patients and themes that would be
logical to use in a sentence where you use that verb.

### Modifiers

When a modifier acts as a noun, it means an uncountable quality and/or degree of
being a given state. Like the affix "-ness" in English. One way of making a noun
out of a modifier is to provide it as the nucleus of a preposition phrase.
Preposition particles always have whatever word is immediately following it is,
take the noun derivation of that word and that is the nucleus of the preposition
phrase.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-zıkto">
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%pön|pön%% %%ü|ü%% %%wölık|wölık%% %%zö|zö%% %%küyö|küyö%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
    %%ʋ̃ı|pön%% %%ɽʄ|ü%% %%ʒıʓ̑ȷ|wölık%% %%ꞇı|zö%% %%ɔʄɀı|küyö%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Another way is to create a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier with the
%%yë|yë%% particle. This particle means that whatever word type that the word
immediately following it is, take the noun derivation of that word type.

This is especially useful for the typical reason that genitive phrases are
useful: it allows you to describe a quality with some modifiers of its own.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-zıkto">
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%töxözü|töxözü%% %%pümi|pümi%% %%yë|yë%% %%ıwotë|ıwotë%% %%ëto|ëto%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="opügido" label="ɽʋʄꜿɟʌ">
    %%cıɋıꞇʄ|töxözü%% %%ʋʄƶɟ|pümi%% %%ɀʇ|yë%% %%ɽȷʒcʇ|ıwotë%% %%ɽʇc|ëto%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
