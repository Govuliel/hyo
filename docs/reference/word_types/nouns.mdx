# Nouns

A type of word that represents an entity (tangible or intangible). Can be
represented by a Noun Phrase (NP) which contains a nucleus and surrounding
quantifiers and modifiers.

## Roles

### Causer / Voluntary Subject

The %%ü|ü%% particle precedes the this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role represents the *causer*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the agent or experiencer of the action.
The nature of this role is that the noun phrase is making the choice to commit
the act of their own free will. 

### Causee / Involuntary Subject

The %%ölë|ölë%% particle precedes the this noun phrase.


During causative sentences, a NP with this role will represent the *causee*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the agent or experiencer of the action.
The nature of this role is that the noun phrase is **not** making the choice to
commit the act of their own free will. Either they are bound/forced to do so or
they do not have the wherewithal to make a conscious choice on the matter and
are acting out of some basic instinst.

### Verbs

When a verb acts as a noun, it represents a archetypal object that has been or
hasn't yet been involved in the happening of that verb action. Like "-able" in
English but also there are many terms that English has to refer to these
entities already. These are direct objects, patients and themes that would be
logical to use in a sentence where you use that verb.

### Modifiers

When a modifier acts as a noun, it means an uncountable quality and/or degree of
being a given state. Like the affix "-ness" in English. One way of making a noun
out of a modifier is to provide it as the nucleus of a preposition phrase.
Preposition particles always have whatever word is immediately following it is,
take the noun derivation of that word and that is the nucleus of the preposition
phrase.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-zıkto">
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%pön|pön%% %%ü|ü%% %%wölık|wölık%% %%zö|zö%% %%küyö|küyö%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="onhukızgo" label="ɽ̃ɂʃɔ̄ȷꜿ">
    %%ʋ̃ı|pön%% %%ɽʄ|ü%% %%ʒıʓ̑ȷ|wölık%% %%ꞇı|zö%% %%ɔʄɀı|küyö%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Another way is to create a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier with the
%%yë|yë%% particle. This particle means that whatever word type that the word
immediately following it is, take the noun derivation of that word type.

This is especially useful for the typical reason that genitive phrases are
useful: it allows you to describe a quality with some modifiers of its own.

<Tabs groupId="popöun-zıkto">
  <TabItem value="latin" label="Latin" default>
    %%töxözü|töxözü%% %%pümi|pümi%% %%yë|yë%% %%ıwotë|ıwotë%% %%ëto|ëto%%
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="onhukızgo" label="ɽ̃ɂʃɔ̄ȷꜿ">
    %%cıɋıꞇʄ|töxözü%% %%ʋʄƶɟ|pümi%% %%ɀʇ|yë%% %%ɽȷʒcʇ|ıwotë%% %%ɽʇc|ëto%%
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
