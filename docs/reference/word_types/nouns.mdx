# Nouns

A type of word that represents an entity (tangible or intangible). Can be
represented by a Noun Phrase (NP) which contains a nucleus and surrounding
quantifiers and modifiers.

## Roles

### Causer / Voluntary Subject

The <HisyeoWord is='ü'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role represents the *causer*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the **agent** or **experiencer** of the
action. The nature of this role is that the marked noun phrase is making the
choice to commit the act of the predicate of their own free will. 

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/> it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the subject of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but by something other
than the marked noun phrase.

### Causee / Involuntary Subject

The <HisyeoWord is='ölë'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

During causative sentences, a NP with this role will represent the *causee*.
Otherwise, an NP with this role will be the agent or experiencer of the action.
The nature of this role is that the marked noun phrase is **not** making the
choice to commit the act of their own free will. Either they are bound/forced to
do so or they do not have the wherewithal to make a conscious choice on the
matter and are acting out of some basic instinst.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/> it has the same
semantic interpretation as the voluntary subject particle.

### Patient, Theme, Stimulus (Direct Object)

The <HisyeoWord is='cö'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used in predicates with transitive verbs that have an argument. The
argument can represent a *patient* (an entity that undergoes the action and
changes state), a *theme* (an entity that undergoes the action but does not
change state), or a *stimulus* (an entity that prompts sensory or emotional
feeling). In English, this represents some of the senses of the word "to" and
"into" (many English verbs don't rely on a preposition particle to
introduce their direct object).

:::caution Base Verbs Without This Particle

Not using this particle can have an impact on how base verb sentences are
interpreted. Without providing a direct object, a base verb is interpreted as
being *intransitive* or in an unthematic and generic manner (since no theme is
being provided).

:::

A **patient** is an entity that undergoes the action and changes state in some
manner. A **theme** is an entiy that undergoes the action but doesn't change
state. A **stimulus** is an entity that prompts or triggers the emotional or
sensory action that is being described. These kinds of direct objects aren't
separately marked because which kind of object is being specified can be
determined from the verb that is being used. The only thing that you must
remember is that only base verbs can take a preposition of this kind. **A
sentence with a base modifier or base noun being used as a verb cannot contain
this preposition.**

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the argument of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with an object
that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Instrument or Manner

The <HisyeoWord is='vio'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent some entity that was used to carry out
the action. It can also represent the way or manner with which the action was
carried out. In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "with",
"using", and "via".

:::info Thematic Relations

This preposition and the remaining described here can be used with intransitive
and transitive verb predicates and are only needed in certain circumstances when
extra thematic information is useful to describing the predicate in a new way.
These prepositions are known as **true thematic relations**. Subjects and
objects are honorary members of the thematic relation club since they are
usually called **morphosyntactic arguments**. They are included in the same
class of word as the true thematic relations to simplify the grammatical system.
This system is what allows the language to have complete **free constituent
ordering**.

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the manner of instrument of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but in a
manner or with an object that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "without".

### Location or Time

The <HisyeoWord is='hoi'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where or when the action occurs. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the words "in", "at", and "on".

The counterpart of this particle is <HisyeoWord is='lon'/> for distance and
duration. Unlike that particle, when you provide an amount of time to <HisyeoWord is='hoi'/> it
means the length of time that it took to achieve the task specified in the rest of the predicate.

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the location or time of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but at a
location or time that is somewhere other than the marked noun phrase.

### Direction or Destination (Indirect Object)

The <HisyeoWord is='müt'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action is directed towards.
In English, this represents some of the senses of the words "to", "into", and
"towards". Any time you might need an **indrect object** or *recipient, you can
use this preposition to describe that constituent.

:::info Reciprocity

When you use this preposition with an NP of:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>xokön dizel</p>
</HisyeoTabs>

it means that the predicate is a reciprocal action which means that it happened
between the subjects instead of the subjects directing that action towards some
other referred entity.

:::

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the recipient of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with recipient
that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Source or Origin

The <HisyeoWord is='sün'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent where the action originated. In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "from".

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the source or origin of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
source or origin that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Beneficiary or Purpose

The <HisyeoWord is='oxon'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent for whose benefit the action occurs or
the reason for the action. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "for".

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the beneficiary/purpose of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
beneficiary/purpose that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

:::info The many faces of the English "for"

There are many varying uses of the English word "for" and they don't all line up
under <HisyeoWord is='oxon'/> so I'd like to take a moment to run through most of

:::
 
### Cause

The <HisyeoWord is='nënko'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent what caused the action to occur or a
past reason that led to the action. Not to be confused with the causer of the
action (<HisyeoWord is='ü'/>), this NP would represent a broader sense including
what caused the causer. In English, this represents some of the senses of the
word "because". 

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the cause of the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a cause
that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the word "despite".

### Collaborator

The <HisyeoWord is='ovek'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent a fellow actor that is also engaged in
the same action as the subject. However, the NP is not considered a subject of
the sentence. In English, this represents some of the senses of the word
"with".

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from participating in the committed
act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a participant
that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the word "without".

### Context or Condition

The <HisyeoWord is='hön'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent an overarching topic, contextual
detail, or a condition for the underlying sentence. In English, this represents
some of the senses of the words "regarding", "given", "as for", and "when".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo yünyoü sölü hön zuwopü ılık. <em>"I have a question regarding your earlier answers."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

Also, when you would like to utilize an adjective complement to complete the
meaning of a subject complete (<HisyeoWord is='lı'/>), you would place the
complement in a <HisyeoWord is='hön'/> NP.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo lı xowosë hön vos nimü köto si ulyö. <em>"I am happy that you said that"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the topic or context of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
topic/context that is something other than the marked noun phrase. In English,
this represents some of the senses of the word "regardless".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>umo Depölo mokon si ünvünö nomü hön yök longı nı. <em>"Deborah ate the broccoli regardless its color."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Counter-Agent

The <HisyeoWord is='dën'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that either represent a special kind of goal/agent for
verbs that indicates an opposing agent for verbs that indicate an action that is
*oppositional* (where both sides are engaging in an opposing action). In
English, this represents some of the senses of the word "against".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>nı lı tüu kutın hön do oütö pı ximu vio woyü dën pono woyü. <em>"It is hard work to sail against the wind."</em></p>
  <p>nimü dën völni yë göcidon ko. <em>"Are you against freedom of choice?"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the counter-agent of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
counter-agent that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Evidence

The <HisyeoWord is='oldıs'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent proof or an information source that the
specified action is known or believed to have occurred, is occurring, or will
occur. In English, this represents some of the senses of the phrases "or so",
"per", and "according to". 

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>hoi mötö xopëk onö ü niün lı si tönkö mötö oldıs vos dizel köto. <em>"He was burned in the fire or so they say"</em></p>
  <p>oldıs yöcno kon köson ü voko ünidü pılit di ülgükin hoi düi dus nonkü suhot. <em>"According to the directions, the glue takes 24 hours to dry"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the proof/source of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with
proof or a source that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Distance or Duration

The <HisyeoWord is='lon'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for NPs that represent the time or space that the action
occurs within. This role is related to the location/time role but it represents
finite physical space or actual time periods. In English, this represents some
of the senses of the word "for".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo köi dëko lon yoüti öni kut cënpö yë zoük. <em>"I can see for kilometres"</em></p>
  <p>nimü lı gö lon üsën zık. <em>"How old are you?"</em></p>
  <p>niün köntësto vio köto lon yoüti lono hön döcui. <em>They argued for days over a toy.</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the distance or duration of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with a
duration or distance that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Intermediate

The <HisyeoWord is='gıtno'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for either a NP that represents the a time or physical entity
that the action occurs between or a conjunction of two NPs that represent two
boundaries in time or space that the action occurs between. In English, this
represents some of the senses of the word "between".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>köi mokon ü noyo cö wutun yë hövezi gemolen et do gıtno piek. <em>"I could eat a hamburger."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is either excluded from being the intermediary entity of the
committed act of the predicate or that the act itself was committed but with an
intermediary that is something other than the marked noun phrase.

### Similative

The <HisyeoWord is='mıslı'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for a NP that represents something that the action or state of
the predicate resembles or is a likeness of. It can also be used to introduce a
[simile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile). In English, this represents some
of the senses of the words "like" and "as". When used with a subordinate clause,
it can also represent the English phrase "as if".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>xoinpo dëko ü loı mıslı sıskın loı. <em>"He looks like his brother."</em></p>
  <p>si tüu cö künhiun pis ü umo moskül nokdo mıslı do ke zigil. <em>"The old man stumbled, as if he were about to fall."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

When used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>, it means that the
marked noun phrase is not a likeness of the action or state of the predicate. In
English, the word "unlike" would be an equivalent.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>mıslı yök nimü lı yök öni cıvulo yë xön ëto ü noyo. <em>"Unlike you, I'm not a great dancer."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

### Genitive

The <HisyeoWord is='yë'/> particle precedes this noun phrase.

This role is used for a NP that is describing the preceding noun or verb phrase
in some contextually dependent manner. In English, this represents some of the
senses of the word "of".

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>niün pı xoinpo lı vonmot yë kon konzilü umo. <em>"He seemed devoid of human feelings."</em></p>
  <p>pëmon in cukto köi di niltügu hoi ozüul woküt hön pëmon yë möi düi zomo. <em>"The contract can be terminated at any time with the agreement of both parties."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>

This particle isn't used with the negatitive particle <HisyeoWord is='yök'/>
because it's meant to describe nouns through associating other nouns and there's
already an existing way to describe zero nouns (<HisyeoWord is='xünyu'/>). You can
achieve a similar kind of negative association by using a relative clause.

## From...

Converting from the other content types into nouns.

### Verbs

When a verb acts as a noun, it represents an archetypal object that has or will
be involved in the happening of that verb action. Like "-ed" in English but also
there are many concrete terms that English has to refer to these entities
already. These are direct objects, patients and themes that would be logical to
use in a sentence where you use that verb.

### Modifiers

When a modifier acts as a noun, it means an uncountable quality and/or degree of
being a given state. Like the affix "-ness" in English. One way of making a noun
out of a modifier is to provide it as the nucleus of a verb or a preposition
phrase. Verbs and preposition particles always take the word is immediately
following it as a noun derivation of that word and it is the nucleus of the
preposition phrase (as long as it's a content word, other prepositions can cause
argument to be skipped).

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>wölık nëlö pön küyö <em>"Black clouds cause sadness."</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


Another way is to create a genitive phrase by preceding the modifier with the <HisyeoWord is='yë'/> particle.
This particle means that whatever word type that the word immediately following
it is, take the noun derivation of that word type.

This is especially useful for the typical reason that genitive phrases are
useful: it allows you to describe a quality with some modifiers of its own. One
of the most common usages is when adding a degree to a modifier:

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>töxütsı pümi yë ıwotë ëto</p>
</HisyeoTabs>


Since Hisyëö has less than 800 words, using genitive phrases with modifiers
allows you to create more complex phrases that would require several sentences
to formulate otherwise. 

## Noun Clauses

A noun can be concrete or abstract, it doesn't have to be some physical entity
or even a finite state. It can be a process or really anything that you might
want to refer to and use as a subject or object of a sentence. In Hisyëö, you
can create these complex nouns by building sentences within a special clause
called a **Noun Clause**. In order to create one of these clauses, you must
start with a particle. There are two special words available that can be used
to introduce a noun clause:

<ol>
  <li><HisyeoWord is='do'/> - Use this one for infinitives and gerunds</li>
  <li><HisyeoWord is='vos'/> - Use this one for complete inner sentences</li>
</ol>

After this particle, you start your sentence. In the infinitive/gerund form, you
do not provide an agent/experiencer (subject) of the sentence because this is
the nature of how infinitives are used: a noun that refers to the meaning
expressed by the inner sentence but referred holisitically as an object in the
outer sentence.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>lı ëo govon ölë noyo ü <strong>do</strong> cöüvon micin. <em>"Cooking fish makes me disgusted"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


:::caution Beware the similarity between gerunds and the abstract particle

While these noun clause gerunds are very useful, you must be careful to discern
the distinction of meaning between the gerund usage of a noun clause leading
particle and the abstract particle preceding a content word. The abstract form
should be thought of as "acts of" or "matters of" which should be seen as more
of a loose relationship than using a noun clause as a gerund. "acts/matters of
eating meat" means something different from "eating meat".

<HisyeoTabs>
    <p>noyo toüyen do mokon oksün.</p>
    <p>noyo toüyen kon mokon oksün.</p>
</HisyeoTabs>


The first sentence implies that the speaker hates specifically the act of eating
meat whereas the second sentence implies that the speaker hates matters of meat
eating altogether which broadens the hate to anything related to the act or its
part in human life or otherwise. 

:::

The other form of noun phrase (<HisyeoWord is='vos'/>) includes a subject or if
one is not provided then, like a normal sentence, it should be intepreted as
"there is" or "it is" depending on the predicate that is provided. This form of
noun phrase is useful when you need to introduce a clause that changes (or
removes) the subject from the underlying sentence. Some verbs primarily are used
with some form of noun clause as their object and this form allows for a
complete sentence to be included as that object.

<HisyeoTabs>
  <p>noyo völun vos nimü völun noyo <em>"I want you to want me"</em></p>
  <p>noyo xiwon vos lı suhot tiü <em>"I wish that it was 5 o'clock"</em></p>
</HisyeoTabs>


:::note English indirect object

The English sentence in the translation above "I want you to want me" is using
an indirect object of "you" and an direct object infinitve phrase of "to want
me". This might seem like the wrong translation since there is a preposition
that Hisyëö typically uses for indirect objects. This is just an example of some
of the irregular English grammar around the use of the verb "to want". In
Hisyëö, the best approach is to use a finite noun phrase where the indirect
object of the English sentence is now the subject of the inner noun clause.

There are other uses of these same clause particles as relative clause
introducers and you can learn more about those usages in the Modifiers chapter.
