I am trying to decide how to handle copulas in Hisyëö. In Kokanu, all modifiers
and nouns are zero copula complements when used in verb form. However, in order
to use a verb as a modifier in a subject-complement sentence, you use the
modifier `si` as a verb and then apply the verb as an adverb to it (in the
following examples, elidable particles are wrapped in parentheses):
```
(men) makan le si     makan
 SM   food  VM exists edibly
The food is edible
```
Hisyëö has the same zero copula complements for modifiers and nouns and the
modifier `gö` is the equivalent to `si` in Kokanu. For sentence order, Hisyëö
leans towards verb-first constituent order within sentences, allowing you to
omit the *verb marker* instead of the subject marker:
```
(lı) gö     mokon  ü  mokon
 VM  exists edibly SM food
The food is edible
```
There are other copulative verbs that complicate things. In Kokanu, the verb
`pi` means "to become" and the object of the verb (and thus the noun form of a
verb) is the *transformation*. Since the direct object phrase (preceded by `in`)
is a noun, in order to use this verb as a copulative (applying a complement to a
subject) you either have to use `si` as a noun or the base noun `sin` and then
apply the complement as a modifier.
```
(men) mi le pi     in sin   canu
 SM   I  VM become OM thing cold
I become cold
```
Kokanu speakers try to get around that by using a relative verb clause:
```
(men) mi le pi     (in) te  canu
 SM   I  VM become  OM  RLV cold
I come to be cold
```
I don't want to have to use a relative clause or a head noun anytime I want to
do a copulative "become" sentence. Also, since verbs are often followed by the
subject, it isn't possible to do the `in` elision like Kokanu does it. Many
natlangs just allow the object of the copulative verb to be an adjective. But, I
don't want to make exceptions in the grammar for a select group of verbs.

Another copulative verb is `pela` which can also be assisted by `te`. In Hisyëö,
we had `vëlu` "to feel" but also `sinus` "to seem". As modifiers, they mean
"felt" and "seemed" respectively. The object of `vëlu`
